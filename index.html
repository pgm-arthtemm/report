        <h2>Is the website easy to use?</h2>
        <p>I'm happy to say that nobody has answered 'Not at all'. But the other 2 answers are pretty even with 'Just about' taking the lead by one vote. We will continue to improve the user experience while we are developing this website.</p>

      <h2>Do you have any tips or overall feedback?</h2>
      <p>We are very happy to see a lot of usefull tips and feedback from the people. We will definitely read this carefully and make adjustments where needed.</p>

          <li>"Link was a bit hidden in the email, not really sure where to click to access the website. For mobile-view I would maybe add a subtle small gray-ish line beneath each project to seperate them more visually. Also when you click on anything of the detail it could collapse, so maybe add a '^'-sort of button to open and close them?"</li>
          <li>"Really nice! Pictures of teh website in the detail of your projects might be a good addition."</li>
          <li>"misschien een linkje naar het project als je er op klikt."</li>
          <li>"I'm guessing not all aspects of the website are finished?"</li>
          <li>"The controls of the donut on the landings page is a bit weird to use. I would assume going up or down with my mouse would do the same. But it goes left instead. The site itself looks very clean and minimalistic and doesn't need to be changed."</li>
          <li>"No"</li>
          <li>"Nice and clean design. Especially the projects overview!"</li>
          <li>"Try to make the information desplayed accessible to users with screen readers or who prefer reduced motion."</li>
          <li>"none at the moment"</li>
          <li>"Design (contact) Let's the finihsed projects (with a link)"</li>
          <li>"No, looks very nice!"</li>
